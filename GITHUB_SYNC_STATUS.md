## Required Actions for GitHub Sync

### 1. Authentication Setup
You need to authenticate with GitHub using one of these methods:

#### Option A: GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# Then login:
gh auth login
```

#### Option B: Personal Access Token (PAT)
1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens
2. Generate a new PAT with 'repo' scope
3. Use the PAT when prompted for password

#### Option C: SSH Keys
```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Add to SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Add public key to GitHub
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```
