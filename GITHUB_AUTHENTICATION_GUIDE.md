## üîê **AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED**

### The Issue
```bash
git push -u origin main
# Output: fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': No such device or address
```

### Solution: GitHub Authentication
You need to authenticate with GitHub using one of these methods:

#### Method 1: GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# On Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt update && sudo apt install gh

# On macOS:
brew install gh

# Login to GitHub
gh auth login

# Follow the prompts:
# - Choose "GitHub.com"
# - Choose "HTTPS" protocol
# - Choose "Yes" to authenticate with git
# - Choose "Login with a web browser"
# - Copy the one-time code and paste it in your browser
# - Complete the authentication in your browser
```

#### Method 2: Personal Access Token (PAT)
1. **Generate PAT**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token" ‚Üí "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Set expiration (recommended: 90 days)
   - Add a note: "KnowYourTax.ai Development"
   - Check the box for `repo` scope
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **Copy the token immediately** (it won't be shown again)

2. **Use PAT for Authentication**:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   # When prompted for username: Your GitHub username
   # When prompted for password: Paste the PAT
   ```

#### Method 3: SSH Keys
```bash
# Generate SSH key
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Start SSH agent
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

# Add SSH key to agent
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

# Copy public key
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

# Add to GitHub:
# - Go to https://github.com/settings/keys
# - Click "New SSH key"
# - Paste the public key
# - Test connection:
ssh -T git@github.com
```

## üöÄ **COMPLETE SYNC PROCESS**

### Step 1: Authenticate
Choose one of the authentication methods above.

### Step 2: Push to GitHub
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Success
```bash
# Check if push was successful
git remote show origin

# Or visit: https://github.com/jitenkr2030/KnowYourTax
```
